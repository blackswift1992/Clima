# Clima

Clima is an application in which a user can find out the weather. This can be done using GPS or simply by entering the name of the city in the search box. It is based on WeatherAPI, REST(JSON), CoreLocation, Swift, UIKit, AutoLayout, GCD, OOP, MVC, etc.

# Screenshots:

1)First of all, when the app starts up, the user is greeted with a warning message asking him to allow "Clima" access to his location. If permission is granted, the GPS search starts ("GPS searching..." message is blinking). So after that the user receives weather in his location.

2)If permission is not granted and the user then presses the GPS button (upper left corner), the user will again receive a warning message asking him to allow Clima access to his location. There's an "Open Settings" button that provides a quick way to activate location detection.

3)Of course, the user can find the weather of any city or country by simply entering the name in the search box. The most popular languages are supported.
